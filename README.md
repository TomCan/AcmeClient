# AcmeLib

PHP Library implementing the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol,
used for requesting certificates from services like Let's Encrypt.

The goal of the project is to create a flexible and extendable library that allows you to incorporate
certificate registration though ACME, without the need of an external tool or client. The library 
requires little to no persistance, allowing you to full integrate in the your project in the way
that suits your project the best.

# Work in progress
This is very much a work in progress. All classes and interfaces are bound to change without notice
until I like it the way that suits me best ;) At this point, use for reference / ideas only.
